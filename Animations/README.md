# Animations

Welcome to the Animations section of the MetaDyn Community Library!

This directory contains a collection of high-quality, platform-agnostic animations that you can use in your Metaverse projects. These animations are designed to be versatile and easily adaptable to various character rigs and game engines.

## How to Use

You can import these animation files (e.g., `.fbx`) directly into your preferred game engine or 3D modeling software. Be sure to consult your platform's documentation for instructions on how to apply animations to your character models.
